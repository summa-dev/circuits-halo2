# ZK Prover

This directory contains the Halo2 ZK circuit implementation for the Summa Proof of Solvency protocol. 

## Usage

To build and test the circuits, execute

```
cargo build
cargo test --release --features dev-graph -- --nocapture
```
## Documentation 

The documentation for the circuits can be generated by running 

```
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

## Powers of Tau Trusted Setup 

In order to test the circuits with a real trusted setup, you need to download the powers of tau files. The powers of tau files can be downloaded from https://github.com/han0110/halo2-kzg-srs and placed in a `ptau` folder. For example, by adding `hermez-raw-9` to the `ptau` folder, the circuit tests will take it as a setup to generate the parameters -> see `generate_setup_params` in [utils](./src/circuits/utils.rs). If no `ptau` folder is found, the tests will generate a new setup from a randomly generated value. This latter approach is not recommended for production.

## Benches 

The benchmarking included the following areas:

- Merkle Sum Tree Generation 
- Verification Key Gen for MstInclusion Circuit
- Proving Key Gen for MstInclusion Circuit
- ZK Proof Generation for MstInclusion Circuit
- ZK Proof Verification for MstInclusion Circuit

In order to run the benchmarking, we provide a set of dummy `username, balances` entries formatted in csv files. The csv files can be downloaded as follows 

``` 
cd benches
mkdir csv
cd csv 
wget https://summa-solvency.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/csv_files.tar.bz2
tar -xjf csv_files.tar.bz2
```

The csv folder will contain two subfolder namely `one_asset` and `two_assets`. Each folders will contain files named as `one_asset_entry_2_17.csv` or `two_assets_entry_2_5.csv`. 2^17 or 2^5 is the number of entries in the file that will be used to feed the merkle sum tree and, eventually, the zk prover. These entries represent the number of users of the exchange.

To run the benches 

`cargo bench` 

You can set the following parameters to run the benches:

- `LEVELS` -> the number of entries in the merkle sum tree. By default it is set to 15, which means that the benches will run for 2^15 entries.
- `SAMPLE_SIZE` -> the number of samples to run for each bench. By default it is set to 10, which is the minimum allowed by criterion.rs
- `N_ASSETS and PATH_NAME` -> the number of assets to be used in the benchmarking. By default it is set to 2. For now you can only switch it between 1 and 2 as these are the only csv folder available. More will be added soon.

Note that the `k` of the circuit may vary based on the LEVELS

Furthermore the benchmarking function `verify_zk_proof_benchmark` will also print out the proof size in bytes.
